<h1 align="left">Hello there👋</h1>

###

<p align="left">My name is Martin Jurkovič, and I am a student at Brno University of Technology, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Communication (BUT FEEC)⚡. I am currently studying the Communications and Informatics master's study program 🎓.</p>

###

<h2 align="left">Something more about me 🙍‍♂️</h2>

###

<p align="left">I do programming as a hobby. In my studies, and also outside of them, I have stepped across many programming languages. But if I had to choose one, it would be Python. For that reason, all of the projects, which you can find on my profile, were done with Python.</p>

###

<p align="left">Lately, what I am most interested in is artificial intelligence and machine learning⚙️.  So most of my recent and likely future projects will have something in common with these areas. And I am genuinely excited about that. I love to learn new things, and these fields constantly offer new challenges and things to learn about🔍.</p>

###

<p align="left">Outside of programming, what is the second most interesting field to me is networking🌐. To be more specific, I am especially excited about the functions and principles of TCP/IP-based networks. With this subject, I am mostly in touch with my studies📚.</p>
