Hello, my name is Martin Jurkovič 👋. I am a student of Brno University of Technology, Faculty of Eletrical Engineering and Communication (BUT FEEC).
I am currently studying Communications and Informatics master's study program 🎓.

Mostly for fun I do coding, especially in Python. Besides Python, I also have experience with other programming languages.
However, recently I have been doing projects in Python and some of my major projects have also been done in Python.
I like to learn new things, so my projects are pretty much varied, as you can see in my [repositories](https://github.com/jurkovicmartin?tab=repositories) .
